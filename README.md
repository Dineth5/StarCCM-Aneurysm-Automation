# StarCCM-Aneurysm-Automation

These macros are designed to help automate your **STAR-CCM+** post-processing workflows. This repository is especially useful for projects involving aneurysms, medical imaging, and other simulations that require consistent documentation across multiple runs.

Once the pre-processing of the mesh file is complete, the included Python file can be run to finalize both pre- and post-processing. This includes auto-generating a presentation with all scenes and plots labeled and ready for reporting.

> üìå **Note:**  
> You can customize most of the behavior and parameters using the `.java` macro files included in this repository.

## üìÇ Files Included

1. **`a1continua.java`**  
   - Sets up the continua with blood properties.

2. **`a2inletvel.java`**  
   - Applies a varying velocity profile using the `unsteadyinlet.csv` file.  
   - ‚ö† Ensure the file directory remains the same (e.g., P-drive).

3. **`a3velocityprobe.java`**  
   - Places a velocity probe at the inlet.  
   - Generates a velocity-time graph.

4. **`a4monitors.java`**  
   - Creates monitors for:  
     - Mean Wall Shear Stress (WSS)  
     - Sum of WSS (i, j, k components)

5. **`a5fieldfunctions.java`**  
   - Defines custom field functions:  
     - OSI (Oscillatory Shear Index)  
     - TA-WSS (Time-Averaged WSS)  
     - RRT (Relative Residence Time)

6. **`a6mesheroperations.java`**  
   - Sets up mesh operations targeting ~1 million cells.

7. **`a7stoppingcrit.java`**  
   - Sets stopping criteria for 2 cardiac cycles (approx. 1.9 seconds).

8. **`a8views.java`**  
   - Saves isometric screenshots (front and back views).

9. **`a9outlet.java`**  
   - Sets outlet split factor to 0.5.

10. **`a10scenes.java`**  
    - Creates scalar scenes for:  
      - WSS  
      - TA-WSS  
      - OSI  
      - RRT  
      - Streamlines

11. **`unsteadyinlet.csv`**  
    - Contains velocity-time data for a normal cardiac cycle.  
    - Used by `a2inletvel.java`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open your active simulation in **STAR-CCM+**.
2. Navigate to:  
   `File ‚Üí Macro ‚Üí Play Macro`
3. Run each macro **in numerical order**:  
   Start with `a1continua.java`, then `a2inletvel.java`, and so on.
4. Allow each macro to finish before proceeding to the next.
5. Macros are modular ‚Äî feel free to skip or customize as needed depending on your workflow.
